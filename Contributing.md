# Contributing

Thanks for thinking about contributing to Gather! Help is more than welcome, but please first discuss the 
change you wish to make via issue, email, or another method with a contributor if it is not addressing an 
existing issue so you don't waste your time. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to contribute but aren't
sure how (eg if you're new to programming or Elixir or want to provide a translation); I'm more than happy to help!

We don't have a code of conduct, please let us keep it that way. :)
